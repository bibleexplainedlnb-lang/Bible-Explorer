const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are a senior Christian content editor with 15 years of experience improving Bible study articles. You rewrite content to sound genuinely human — not robotic, not generic, not AI-generated. You keep the original meaning and doctrinal stance intact while making the writing more engaging, clearer, and practically valuable. You respond with the improved HTML only, exactly as instructed.`;

const USER_PROMPT = (title, category, content) => `Improve and restructure this Christian article titled "${title}" (category: ${category}).

CURRENT CONTENT (HTML):
${content}

IMPROVEMENT REQUIREMENTS:

STRUCTURE — add these if missing:
- SEO-optimised headings (use <h2> for main sections, <h3> for subsections)
- <h2>What This Means for You</h2> — specific, concrete application to real life
- <h2>How to Apply This</h2> — 3–4 practical steps, each grounded in Scripture

WRITING QUALITY:
- Rewrite to sound natural and human — like a thoughtful pastor or trusted friend wrote it
- Vary sentence length deliberately: short punchy sentences mixed with longer nuanced ones
- Use contractions naturally (it's, you're, we've, isn't, didn't)
- Speak directly to the reader: "you", "your", "we", "us" — never "one" or generic "Christians"
- Keep every Bible verse and reference exactly as written — do not invent new ones
- Cut any padding or repetition — every paragraph must add distinct value
- Acknowledge difficulty honestly where appropriate — faith is hard sometimes

BANNED PHRASES — never use:
- "In today's world" / "In a world where" / "In today's fast-paced"
- "It's important to note" / "It is worth noting" / "It goes without saying"
- "Delve into" / "Dive into" / "Embark on" / "Journey into"
- "Let's explore" / "Let's look at" / "Let's dive"
- "Transformative" / "Game-changer" / "Holistic" / "Robust"
- "At the end of the day" / "The bottom line is"
- "As we can see" / "As mentioned above"
- "In conclusion," / "To sum up," as paragraph openers

KEEP INTACT:
- Original meaning and doctrinal stance (evangelical, biblically faithful)
- All Bible verse references (Book Chapter:Verse format)
- HTML tag structure: only p, h2, h3, ul, ol, li, strong, blockquote
- Format directly quoted Bible verse text as: <blockquote>"Verse text" (Book Chapter:Verse)</blockquote>
- Do NOT add h1 tags or markdown

RETURN: The improved article as a valid HTML string only. No JSON wrapper. No explanation. No preamble. Start with a <p> or <h2> tag.`;
