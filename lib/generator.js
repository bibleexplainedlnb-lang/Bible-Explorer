const BANNED_PHRASES = `BANNED PHRASES — never use any of these:
- "In today's world" / "In today's fast-paced world" / "In a world where"
- "It's important to note" / "It is worth noting" / "It goes without saying"
- "As we can see" / "As mentioned above" / "As previously discussed"
- "Delve into" / "Dive into" / "Embark on" / "Journey into"
- "Let's explore" / "Let's dive" / "Let's look at"
- "Transformative" / "Game-changer" / "Holistic" / "Robust"
- "At the end of the day" / "The bottom line is"
- "Furthermore, it is" / "Moreover, it is" / "Additionally, it should be noted"
- Passive openers like "Faith is important." or "Prayer matters."
- Filler closers like "May God bless you on your journey."
- Any sentence that just restates the topic without adding meaning`;

const KEYWORD_VARIATION_RULES = `KEYWORD VARIATION — follow strictly:
- faith / trust in God / belief / confidence in God / reliance on Him — rotate, never repeat the same word in adjacent paragraphs
- fear / anxiety / worry / doubt / dread — vary naturally through the piece
- prayer / praying / talking with God / seeking God / turning to Him — mix organically
- love / compassion / care / kindness / grace — alternate throughout
- forgiveness / mercy / releasing bitterness / letting go — use varied phrasing
- The primary topic keyword appears at most 2–3 times total. Spread synonyms through the rest. Never keyword-stuff.`;

const HUMAN_WRITING_RULES = `HUMAN WRITING RULES — mandatory:
1. Open with something concrete: a scenario, a honest question, a short story beat, or a struggle — never a definition or generic statement
2. Use contractions naturally (it's, you're, we've, isn't, didn't, won't) — a human wrote this
3. Vary sentence length deliberately — short punchy sentences. Then a longer one that builds an idea with more texture and nuance. Then short again.
4. Speak directly to the reader: "you", "your", "we", "us" — not "one" or "Christians"
5. Each paragraph must introduce one distinct idea — no padding, no summarising the previous paragraph
6. Bible verses: when directly quoting a verse, format it as a blockquote: <blockquote>"Verse text here." (Book Chapter:Verse)</blockquote> — then unpack what it means in context in the following paragraph
7. Include at least one honest acknowledgement of difficulty — faith is hard sometimes; acknowledge it
8. Avoid ending sections with a tidy bow — real life is messier; close with something to sit with
9. Never start two consecutive paragraphs with the same word
10. The conclusion must not begin with "In conclusion" or "To sum up"`;

const PRACTICAL_VALUE_RULES = `PRACTICAL VALUE — every article must include:
- A section (or paragraph) titled or themed "What This Means for You" — specific, not generic
- A section (or paragraph) themed "How to Apply This" — concrete steps, not vague encouragement
- At least one real-life example or scenario that a reader can recognise themselves in`;

const HTML_RULES = `HTML OUTPUT RULES — mandatory:
- Use only these tags: p, h2, h3, ul, ol, li, strong, blockquote
- Do NOT use h1 (the page title serves as h1)
- Do NOT use markdown — no asterisks, no #, no **bold**
- All double-quotes inside the JSON content field must be escaped as \\"
- No broken HTML — every opened tag must be closed
- No inline styles or class attributes
- Quoted Bible verses must use: <blockquote>"Verse text." (Book Chapter:Verse)</blockquote>
- Unquoted verse references inline: e.g. Romans 8:28`;
